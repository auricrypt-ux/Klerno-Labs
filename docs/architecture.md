    """
    Asynchronous report generation with progress tracking
    """
    # Query transactions in chunks
    transactions = await fetch_transactions_chunked(date_range)
    
    # Process in parallel
    tasks = [analyze_chunk(chunk) for chunk in chunk_data(transactions)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
